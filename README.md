I've built a backend API using Node.js and Express.js. It connects to a MongoDB database and is designed to handle CRUD operations via HTTP requests. I’ve set up CORS to enable cross-origin requests, and I’ve configured the server to handle JSON payloads. The server runs on port 5001, and the routes are organized to allow easy expansion, with routes like /api/users available to manage user data.
